            Aberrant information processing in the basal ganglia and connected cortical areas are key to many neurological movement disorders such as Parkinson’s disease. Investigating the electrophysiology of this system is difficult in humans because non-invasive methods, such as electroencephalography or magnetoencephalography, have limited sensitivity to deep brain areas. Recordings from electrodes implanted for therapeutic deep brain stimulation, in contrast, provide clear deep brain signals but are not suited for studying cortical activity. Therefore, we combine magnetoencephalography and local field potential recordings from deep brain stimulation electrodes in individuals with Parkinson’s disease. Here, we make these data available, inviting a broader scientific community to explore the dynamics of neural activity in the subthalamic nucleus and its functional connectivity to cortex. The dataset encompasses resting-state recordings, plus two motor tasks: static forearm extension and self-paced repetitive fist clenching. Most patients were recorded both in the medicated and the unmedicated state. Along with the raw data, we provide metadata on channels, events and scripts for pre-processing to help interested researchers get started.},
